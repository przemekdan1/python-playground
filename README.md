# Notebook Overview: Python Lecture Notes

This notebook brings together all my markdown notes from Python lectures. I compiled these notes to help me remember and understand concepts better, especially with practical examples. Alongside, I also created a personal dictionary with translations of unfamiliar terms I encountered during the lectures.
